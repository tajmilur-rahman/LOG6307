\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Quality assurance in software development plays the prominent role for a software to turn it into a successful business product. Doing business with a software product by providing services or by selling the software itself demands high level of quality assurance and quality can be assured in software industries by unit test, black-box, white-box, integration, functional and system level testing. Testing is not just the end of the quality assurance but the start of working for assuring quality of a software system. Testing produces list of regressions and flaws throughout the system that keeps the development team busy for fixing bugs to make the system flaw-less. Generally this fixing and testing be practised during the stabilization period once all the new feature development works are done. We can estimate development time and cost prior to a development cycle but the effort that stabilization period consumes for fixing does influence the cost of software product and reputation of the software industry.

In current trend many researchers are focusing on predicting defects in the code-base of the software system~\cite{Gyimothy2005IEEE}. In some contexts this approach can be useful but they have drawbacks. Predicting bugs does not specify the amount of work and cannot minimize the effort in a great deal but comparatively predicting the particular change that could be defect inducing would be more efficient to reduce the effort for fixing bugs around the time of release. This is really important for reducing the stabilization time and releasing the software product sooner to beat competitors in the market.

\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:backgr-relat-work}

Phasellus laoreet ipsum non nunc sodales molestie. Aliquam rutrum urna ante, at dictum odio dictum in. Quisque sit amet lorem non mi adipiscing aliquam. Suspendisse potenti. Aenean congue a risus vel posuere. Vestibulum tempor commodo ipsum vitae congue. Nunc vestibulum volutpat sapien quis tincidunt. Vestibulum vitae ullamcorper eros. Integer luctus quam risus~\cite{humble10}. Suspendisse scelerisque nulla nulla, sed ullamcorper enim faucibus sed. Curabitur bibendum ipsum quis justo tincidunt, et pulvinar enim ullamcorper. Pellentesque et tempor turpis. Pellentesque vel nisi metus. Proin laoreet vehicula vestibulum. Vivamus iaculis urna velit, et pharetra risus scelerisque quis~\cite{baysal11}.

\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|p{3cm}|p{6cm}|l|}
	\hline Dim. & Name & Definition & Rationale & Related Work \\ 
	\hline \multirow{10}{*}{\begin{sideways}Diffusion\end{sideways}} & NS & Number of modified subsystems  & Changes modifying many subsystems are more likely to be defect-prone. &  \\ \cline{2-5}  
	 & ND & Number of modified directories & Changes touching many files are more likely to be defect-prone. &  \\ \cline{2-5}  
	 & NF & Number of modified files & Changes touching many files are more likely to be defect-prone. &  \\ \cline{2-5} 
	 & Entropy & Distribution of modified code across each file & Changes with high entropy are more likely to be defect-prone, because a developer will have to recall and track large numbers of scattered changes across each file. &  \\ 
	\hline \multirow{2}{*}{\begin{sideways}Size\end{sideways}} & LA & Lines of code added & The more lines of code added, the more likely a defect is introduced. &  \\ \cline{2-5} 
	  & LD & Lines of code deleted & The more lines of code deleted, the higher the chance of a defect. &  \\ 
	\hline Purpose & FIX & Whether or not the change is defect fix & Fixing a defect means that an error was made in an earlier implementation, therefore it may indicate an area where errors are more likely. &  \\ 
	\hline \multirow{3}{*}{\begin{sideways}History\end{sideways}} & NDEV & The number of developers that changed the modified files & The larger the NDEV, the more likely a defect is introduced, because files revised by many developers often contain different design thoughts and coding styles. &  \\ \cline{2-5} 
	& AGE & The avergae time interval between the last and current change & The lower the AGE (i.e., the more recent the last change), the more likely a defect will be introduced. &  \\ \cline{2-5} 
	& NUC & The number of unique changes to the modified files & The larger the NUC, the more likely a defect is introduced, because a developer will have to recalland track many previous changes. &  \\ 
	\hline \multirow{3}{*}{\begin{sideways}Experience\end{sideways}} & EXP & Developer experience & More experienced developers are less likely to introduced a defect. &  \\ \cline{2-5} 
	& REXP & Recent developer experience & A developer that has often modified the files in recent months is less likely to introduce defect, because they will be more familiar with recent developments in the system. &  \\ \cline{2-5} 
	& SEXP & Developer experience on a subsystem & Developers that are familiar with the subsystems modified by a change are less likely to introduce defects. &  \\

	12/07/2005 - 19/09/2014  & 26606  & 28.2% & 142.5 & 272.3 & 4.6 & 7.9 & 143 & 5.7 \\
